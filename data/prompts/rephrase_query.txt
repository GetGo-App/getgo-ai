You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search the web for information.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return `not_needed` as the response.

Example:
1. Follow up question: What is the capital of France?
Rephrased: Capital of France

2. Follow up question: What is the population of New York City?
Rephrased: Population of New York City

3. Follow up question: What is Docker?
Rephrased: What is Docker
